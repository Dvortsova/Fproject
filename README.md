Getting and cleaning data final rpoject

Here you can find the R code to perform the analisys.
R code goes like: 
# define your derictory.
# download zip file.
# unzip it.
# dowload to R train and test data sets. Also list of sibjects,  activities indicators and variables names. 
# merge data to create full data set with both train and set information. For all measurements, subjects and activities indicators.
# giving real names to variables.
# transform to string format activities variable as well as description of activities codes in order to be able to match them properly.
# renaming activities codes with the real names by using for-loop.
# leaving only mean and std variables. I used the corresponding colomn indices to define these variables.
# Grouping by subject and activity groups.
# Finding means of measurements for the variables based on the defined groups (Group.1 - subject; Group.2 - activity)
# Rearanging data set so the results (means)  can be nicely visible.
# Saving tidy dataset in txt format.
